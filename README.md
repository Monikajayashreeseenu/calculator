Level-1 (task-1)
calculator:
This task involves developing a calculator application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of the Oasis Infobyte Web Development & Designing Internship (Level 2).

The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations along with additional features such as percentage calculation, square root, brackets, decimal values, double zero (00), clear (AC), delete (DEL), and ANS functionality. The project focuses on DOM manipulation, event handling, logical conditions, and responsive UI design.

This task helped strengthen front-end development skills and practical JavaScript implementation.
